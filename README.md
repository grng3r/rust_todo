Thi project was inspired by an video featured on the Coding Garden with CJ, the difference is 
this program saves the list to a file on each change. It is an interactive todo list program.

To build the program run for Linux:
	cargo build --release
To run program use commands: todo read\n
				  add <"task">
				  del <task number>
				  done <task number>

The commands sekf explanatory, but it is worth mentioning that the done command both marks the
task done and undone, depending on how it is currently marked.
It is released under the GNU license, do whatever you like with the program.
